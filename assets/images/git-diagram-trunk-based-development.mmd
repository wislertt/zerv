    %% Step 1: Initial commit on main with v1.0.0 tag
    commit id: "1.0.0"

    %% Step 2: Create parallel feature branches feature-1 and feature-2 from main
    branch feature-1 order: 2
    branch feature-2 order: 3

    %% Step 3: feature-2: Start development with dirty state
    checkout feature-2
    commit type:REVERSE id: "1.0.1-alpha.68031.post.0.dev.{timestamp}" tag: "uncommitted"

    %% Step 4: feature-2: Create first commit
    commit id: "1.0.1-alpha.68031.post.1"

    %% Step 5: feature-1: Create commits (parallel development)
    checkout feature-1
    commit id: "1.0.1-alpha.42954.post.1"
    commit id: "1.0.1-alpha.42954.post.2"

    %% Step 6: feature-1: Merge to main and release v1.0.1
    checkout main
    merge feature-1 id: "1.0.1" tag: "feature-1 released"

    %% Step 7: feature-2: Sync with main to get feature-1 changes
    checkout feature-2
    merge main id: "1.0.2-alpha.68031.post.2"

    %% Step 8: feature-2: Create additional commit
    commit id: "1.0.2-alpha.68031.post.3"

    %% Step 9: feature-3: Branch from feature-2 for sub-feature development
    branch feature-3 order: 4
    checkout feature-3
    commit id: "1.0.2-alpha.14698.post.4"

    %% Step 10: feature-3: Continue development with dirty state
    commit type:REVERSE id: "1.0.2-alpha.14698.post.4.dev.{timestamp}" tag: "uncommitted"

    %% Step 11: feature-3: Continue development with commits
    commit id: "1.0.2-alpha.14698.post.5"
    commit id: "1.0.2-alpha.14698.post.6"

    %% Step 12: feature-2: Merge feature-3 back to continue development
    checkout feature-2
    merge feature-3 id: "1.0.2-alpha.68031.post.6" tag: "feature-3 merged"

    %% Step 13: feature-2: Final development before release
    commit id: "1.0.2-alpha.68031.post.7"

    %% Step 14: Final release: feature-2 merges to main and releases v1.1.0
    checkout main
    merge feature-2 id: "1.1.0" tag: "feature-2 released"
