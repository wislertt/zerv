**Total Test Utils Gaps**: ~105 uncovered lines in 4 files

---

## Context

**Initial**: Test coverage was 88.90% (3,469/3,902 lines) with significant gaps.

**Current**: Test coverage is **89.50% (3,469/3,876 lines)** after dead code removal phase.

While 89.5% is solid, there are still critical gaps that need to be addressed:

### Files with 0% Coverage (Updated)

- ~~src/version/zerv/utils/general.rs~~ ✅ **REMOVED (dead code)**
- ~~src/version/semver/utils.rs~~ ✅ **REMOVED (dead code)**
- **src/test_utils/git/mod.rs** - 0% (0/6 lines)
- **src/test_utils/git/native.rs** - 0% (0/24 lines)
- **src/test_utils/version.rs** - 0% (0/31 lines)

**Total**: 3 files with 0% coverage (61 uncovered lines) - **Down from 5 files (87 lines)**

### Coverage Distribution

- Files with <80% coverage: ~17 files (estimated 266 uncovered lines)
- Files with 0% coverage: 3 files (61 uncovered lines)
- **Total gap to 95%**: 213 additional lines to cover

**Key Remaining Issues**:

1. ~~Production utility functions completely untested~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**
2. Large coverage gaps in core components (zerv/components.rs: 38 missing lines)
3. Test utilities themselves poorly tested (acceptable but should be improved)
4. Error paths and edge cases likely uncovered in many modules

---

## Goals

### Primary Goal ✅ Updated

Increase coverage from **89.5% to 95%+** (213 additional lines)

### Secondary Goal ✅ Partially Complete

~~Achieve 100% coverage on all critical utility functions~~

- ✅ Removed dead code instead of testing it
- 🎯 Continue identifying and removing dead code where possible

### Tertiary Goal 🎯

Ensure all production code (excluding test_utils) has >90% coverage

---

## Implementation Strategy Update

### Strategy Change: Dead Code First 🔴 **NEW APPROACH**

Based on success of dead code removal, **prioritize finding and removing unused code** before writing tests:

**Benefits**:

- Faster coverage improvement
- Reduces maintenance burden
- No tests needed for code that shouldn't exist
- Improves codebase health

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ ~~Scan for unused exports and functions~~ (Completed: 2 functions removed)
2. 🔍 **Look for more dead code in other modules**
3. 🔍 **Review 0% coverage files** - are they actually used?
4. 🔍 **Check low-coverage functions** - are they called anywhere?

---

## Implementation Plan (Updated)

### Phase 0: Dead Code Removal (NEW) 🔴 **COMPLETED**

**Goal**: Find and remove unused code before writing tests

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Found 26 lines of dead code

**Results**:

- ✅ Removed 2 unused functions (26 lines)

- **Recommendation**: Skip or deprioritize unless blocking other work

**Estimated time**: 60 minutes (if prioritizing)

---

**Phase 2 Total**: ~~56 lines~~ **35 lines remaining** (21 lines removed), ~60 minutes
**Coverage gain**: 90.0% → 91.0% (~1.0%)

---

### Phase 3: High-Impact Files (Target: +2.0% coverage) 🟡

**Goal**: Address the two largest coverage gaps

#### 3.1 src/version/zerv/components.rs (74.8% → 90%+)

- **Lines to cover**: 38 lines (LARGEST GAP)
- **Complexity**: High
- **File**: `src/version/zerv/components.rs`

**Strategy**:

1. Open HTML coverage report to identify uncovered lines
2. Likely uncovered: Error paths, edge cases in component parsing/validation
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for uncovered paths

**Estimated time**: 90 minutes

---

#### 3.2 src/test_utils/version_args.rs (75.2% → 90%+) **SKIP RECOMMENDED**

- **Lines to cover**: 40 lines (SECOND LARGEST GAP)
- **Complexity**: High
- **File**: `src/test_utils/version_args.rs`

**Recommendation**: **SKIP** - This is test utilities, acceptable to have 75% coverage

- Focus efforts on production code instead
- Only revisit if time permits after reaching 95% on production code

**Estimated time**: N/A (skipped)

---

**Phase 3 Total**: 38 lines (40 lines skipped), ~90 minutes
**Coverage gain**: 91.0% → 92.0% (~1.0%)

---

### Phase 4: Remaining Moderate Coverage Files (Target: +3.0% coverage) 🟢

**Goal**: Push remaining production files to 90%+

#### Priority Files (Production Code):

1. **src/version/semver/to_zerv.rs** (75.3%) - 23 lines
2. **src/version/zerv/bump/schema_processing.rs** (75.0%) - 21 lines
3. **src/cli/app.rs** (71.4%) - 6 lines
4. **src/cli/check.rs** (71.4%) - 8 lines
5. **src/version/pep440/display.rs** (73.3%) - 8 lines
6. **src/cli/utils/template/types.rs** (78.9%) - 8 lines

**Total**: 74 lines in production code

#### Lower Priority (Test Utils):

7. **src/test_utils/version_args.rs** (75.2%) - 40 lines - **SKIP**
8. Other test_utils files - **SKIP**

**Strategy**:

- Focus ONLY on production code (items 1-6)
- Review HTML coverage report for each file
- Prioritize smaller gaps first (items 3-6, then 1-2)
- Check for dead code before writing tests

**Estimated time**: 100 minutes (production code only)

**Phase 4 Total**: 74 lines, ~100 minutes
**Coverage gain**: 92.0% → 95.0%+ (~3.0%)

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Dead code removal is highly effective**
    - Gained 0.60% coverage without writing tests
    - Improved codebase health
    - Reduced maintenance burden

2. **Systematic approach**
    - Using grep to find unused functions
    - Verifying with test runs
    - Removing exports along with functions

### Updated Strategy 🎯

1. **Always check for dead code first** before writing tests
2. **Don't test test utilities obsessively** - 70-80% is acceptable
3. **Focus on production code** - target 95%+ there
4. **Use HTML coverage reports** to identify exact gaps
5. **Remove before adding** - prefer deletion to testing dead code

### Next Actions 🚀

1. Continue Phase 1: Check remaining low-coverage files for dead code
2. Open HTML coverage report to identify exact uncovered lines
3. Write tests for confirmed-needed code
4. Focus on production code, skip test_utils with 75%+ coverage

---

## Risk Assessment (Updated)

### High Risk 🔴

- ~~Phase 3 files are complex~~ → **Only doing Phase 3.1 (components)**
    - Mitigation: Focus on production code only, skip test utilities

### Medium Risk 🟡

- **Uncovered lines may be unreachable code** → Keep checking for dead code
    - Mitigation: Continue checking usage before writing tests

### Low Risk 🟢

- ✅ Phase 0 (dead code) completed successfully
- Phase 1 is straightforward
- Existing test utilities are well-established
- Coverage tools are working correctly
